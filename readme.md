# README 

This repository contains the data and scripts to replicate the analysis of the following study:

Ofodile, Lotachukwu., Appenteng, Judith., Jaffri, Mubeen., Dworkin, Ian. & Stewart, Andrew D. 2025. No degradation of temperature-mediated phenotypic plasticity in *Drosophila melanogaster* after more than 275 generations of artificial selection on body-size. microPublication BIOLOGY. Accepted.

In brief, the students reared the flies from the body-size artificial selection treatment lineages at three different temperatures and measured the thorax length of males and females at each temperature.

## summary of experimental variables

Image_ID - image file identifier, removed from csv.

Treat -  what body-size treatment the flies come from

Temp - what temperature the flies were reared at

Rep -  which replicate block (Rep) of the experiment was done (the project was done in two replicate blocks).

Vial - replicate vial within block

Note - only 1 of the 2 evolutionary replicate lineage within each treatment was measured in this experiment.


There is a single script to run all analyses.
